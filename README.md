The algorithms have been tested successfully on a number of cello recordings downloaded from <a href = "http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html#">

This <a href = https://github.com/orchidas/Pitch-Tracking/tree/master/eckf_pitch_final>subfolder</a> contains programs that employ the Extended Kalman Filter in Pitch Tracking. The ECKF performs sample-synchronous pitch tracking, unlike the other algorithms that perform block based pitch detection. This is a novel algorithm to be published in the proceedings of DAFx. The paper will be uploaded soon.
